# ✅ Admin Customers Page Created

## Problem
The `/admin/customers` page was returning a 404 error because the page didn't exist.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Created Missing Directory Structure**
- Created `/src/app/admin/customers/` directory
- Added `page.tsx` file for the customers page

### 2. **Added Customer Types**
Updated `src/types/index.ts` with:
- `Customer` interface - matches database schema
- `CreateCustomerData` interface - for creating new customers
- `UpdateCustomerData` interface - for updating existing customers

### 3. **Created Full-Featured Customers Page**
Built `src/app/admin/customers/page.tsx` with:
- ✅ **Customer listing** with search and filtering
- ✅ **Responsive table** showing customer details
- ✅ **Status badges** (Active/Inactive)
- ✅ **Contact information** display (email, phone)
- ✅ **Address information** display
- ✅ **Action buttons** (View, Edit, Delete)
- ✅ **Search functionality** by name or email
- ✅ **Status filtering** (All, Active, Inactive)
- ✅ **Loading states** and empty states
- ✅ **Admin authentication** wrapper

### 4. **Database Integration**
- ✅ Connected to existing `customers` table
- ✅ Proper RLS policies applied
- ✅ Sample data already exists (8 customers)

## Features Included

### **Customer Information Display:**
- Full name and customer ID
- Email and phone number
- Complete address (city, state, postal code, country)
- Account status (Active/Inactive)
- Registration date

### **Functionality:**
- Search customers by name or email
- Filter by status (All/Active/Inactive)
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Loading states
- Empty state handling

### **Actions Available:**

- Edit customer information
- Delete customer (with confirmation)
- Add new customer (button ready)

## Database Schema Used
```sql
customers table:
- id (UUID)
- email (TEXT, unique)
- first_name (TEXT)
- last_name (TEXT)
- phone (TEXT, nullable)
- address_line_1 (TEXT, nullable)
- address_line_2 (TEXT, nullable)

- postal_code (TEXT, nullable)
- country (TEXT, default: 'Bangladesh')
- is_active (BOOLEAN, default: true)

```

## Files Created/Modified:
- ✅ `src/app/admin/customers/page.tsx` - Main customers page

- ✅ Database already had sample customers

## Now Working:
- ✅ `/admin/customers` - No more 404 error
