# ✅ Navigation Links Fixed

## Problem
The admin navigation was pointing to incorrect URLs:
- `/admin/products/add` → 404 Error
- `/admin/categories/add` → 404 Error

## Root Cause
The AdminSidebar navigation links were pointing to `/add` routes, but the actual pages were located at `/new` routes:
- Actual pages: `/admin/products/new` and `/admin/categories/new`
- Navigation links: `/admin/products/add` and `/admin/categories/add`

## Solution Applied
Updated the AdminSidebar navigation links in `src/components/layout/AdminSidebar.tsx`:

### Before:
```typescript
{ title: 'Add Product', href: '/admin/products/add', icon: Package },
{ title: 'Add Category', href: '/admin/categories/add', icon: FolderOpen },
```

### After:
```typescript
{ title: 'Add Product', href: '/admin/products/new', icon: Package },
{ title: 'Add Category', href: '/admin/categories/new', icon: FolderOpen },
```

## Verification
✅ All navigation links now point to existing pages
✅ Admin dashboard quick actions already use correct URLs
✅ Product and category list pages use correct URLs
✅ No 404 errors when clicking navigation links

## Pages That Now Work:
- ✅ `/admin/products/new` - Add Product page
- ✅ `/admin/categories/new` - Add Category page
- ✅ All other admin navigation links work correctly

## Files Modified:
- `src/components/layout/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Fixed navigation URLs
