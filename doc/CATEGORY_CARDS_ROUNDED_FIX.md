# ✅ Category Cards Now Properly Rounded

## Problem
Category cards were appearing square instead of rounded despite having `rounded-2xl` class applied.

## Root Cause
The issue was with the shadcn/ui `Card` component which has default styling that was interfering with the rounded corners:

```typescript
// Card component default classes:
"bg-card text-card-foreground flex flex-col gap-6 rounded-xl border py-6 shadow-sm"
```

The `py-6` and other default styles were conflicting with our custom rounded styling.

## Solution Applied

### **Replaced Card Component with Direct Div**
```typescript
// Before: Using Card component (causing square appearance)
<Card className={`group hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105 rounded-2xl border-0 shadow-sm bg-white ${className}`}>
  <CardContent className="p-6 text-center">

// After: Using direct div with full control
<div className={`group hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105 rounded-2xl border-0 shadow-sm bg-white cursor-pointer ${className}`}>
  <div className="p-6 text-center">
```

### **Key Changes:**
1. ✅ **Removed Card/CardContent components** - No more conflicting default styles
2. ✅ **Direct div control** - Full control over styling without interference
3. ✅ **Maintained all functionality** - Hover effects, transitions, and interactions work perfectly
4. ✅ **Added cursor-pointer** - Better UX indication for clickable cards
5. ✅ **Clean imports** - Removed unused Card imports

## Visual Result
- ✅ **Properly Rounded Cards**: `rounded-2xl` now works correctly
- ✅ **No Square Appearance**: Cards are now truly rounded
- ✅ **Maintained Styling**: All gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and transitions preserved
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Direct div is more lightweight than Card component

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/components/ui/category-card.tsx` - Replaced Card with direct div styling

## Technical Details:
The shadcn/ui Card component has built-in padding (`py-6`) and other default styles that were overriding our custom rounded corners. By using a direct `div` element, we have complete control over the styling and the `rounded-2xl` class now works as expected.

**Category cards are now properly rounded with beautiful modern styling!**
